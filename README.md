## Installation

Download and Uncompress the theme package archive in your desired folder location.

Download and install Node.js LTS from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

```bash
npm install
```

After npm finishes installing the modules from package.json you can go ahead and start the application. To do so, run the command below.

```bash
npm run start
```

After the command finished, you should see a Compiled successfully! message in your terminal window. Also, a web server service will be started so you can view your app in the browser: http://localhost:3000

To create a production optimized build run the command below:

```bash
npm run build
```

This created another folder in the root of your project named build. You'll have an option to start a local web server to view your newly created production build.

```bash
npx serve -s build -l 4000
```

This will start a local web server on port 4000, on which the production folder (/build/) will be available in your browser.
